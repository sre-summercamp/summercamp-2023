The platform that supports cancer patients on their path to resilience. 

**The problem we want to solve** 

Cancer patients do not benefit from any personalised follow-up of their treatments, even though they are fighting a double battle: against the disease, but also against the side effects.

**Our mission**

Universalise medical excellence in oncology to enable people to live better and longer.

**Our vision**

In the face of inequalities in access to medicine, which are particularly tangible for cancer patients, technology must be placed at the service of oncology in order to improve access to knowledge and the effectiveness of therapies.
