# Kube Events

- **When is the next Kube-related conference?** _(apart from KubeCon, of course)_
- Did you know that there was **a meetup last week that covered Kubernetes node scaling with Karpenter?**
- When is the next in-person conference?

_Wouldn't it be great if there was a website where you could see all upcoming Kubernetes events?_

Enter Kube Events.

Kube Events has a simple goal: surfacing the best upcoming Kubernetes events around you and online.

The team at Learnk8s curates every entry and lists only meetups, webinars, training, and conferences related to Kubernetes.
